## Overview

Perkify is a full-stack Android application with functunality built for both Users and Merchants. For the Front-End we combined the use of React Native and Typescript along with a number of of packages to deliver a fast and visually appealing UI. We fetch the data from our Node Postgres API which stores the data of Merchants, Loyalty cards and Loyalty programs.

### Key-features

Users are able to:

- Login/Logout
- View a list of participating Merchants
- View Merchants information such as name, contact details, google Maps location
- Filtering Merchants by category
- Search for Merchants
- View list of Merchants loyalty programmes and requirements to redeem offer
- Present a QR code for Merchants to receive points
- View progress on loyalty stamp cards
- redeem a complete stamp Card
- delete their account

Merchants are able to:

- use all features that a standard User has
- Add and remove loyalty points using a built in camera scanner to scan QR codes

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
